Selenium & BeautifulSoup-powered single-page application scraper
===============================

A basic working model of scraping that which doesn't lend itself to scraping, that is, the single-page application sort of page, in this case, a Firebase and ReactJS-powered deal, [http://trialsresults.usatf.org](http://trialsresults.usatf.org), from U.S. Track & Field for the 2016 U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials held in Eugene, Ore., June 30 - Jul 10.

`usatf.p` is a Python pickled selenium webdriver-generated page for using with `bs.py` to tweak the `BeautifulSoup` munging separately, so you don't have to request and wait the live page every time.
